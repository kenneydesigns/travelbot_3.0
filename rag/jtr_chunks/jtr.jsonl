Return travel to the PDS OCONUS is not authorized at Government expense unless the incident requiring the early return was because the dependent\u2019s safety could not be ensured due to adverse public feeling in the area or due to force protection and antiterrorism considerations. 4. If the dependent returns to the PDS OCONUS at personal expense, and is then command- sponsored, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the PDS OCONUS on the next PCS. E. National Interest 1. Eligibility. A command-sponsored dependent at a location OCONUS may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances when the Secretary concerned or a more senior official determines that a dependent must return early for reasons of national interest. 2. Allowances. The major commander, or his or her designated representative, may authorize PCS travel and transportation allowances to a designated place or, if the dependent is foreign- born, to a designated place in the dependent\u2019s native country. a. If the Service member receives a PCS order to a different PDS where dependent travel is authorized, the dependent travel and transportation allowances are from the designated place to the new PDS. b.

Table 5-22 specifies the only circumstances when dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized by this paragraph. ERD must be authorized judiciously as the last resort. If the Service member\u2019s situation does not meet the criteria, the request must be denied. When the approving official requests it, supporting documentation is required in addition to the travel order. a. When a dependent travels without an order, the Service member receives no reimbursement for the travel even if an order is later issued, unless the travel is due to a death, serious illness, or incapacitation of a dependent or the dependent has compelling personal reasons. b. Recommendations from religious, mental health, financial management, family counseling, or legal agencies should be obtained, if appropriate, to demonstrate the need for an ERD. 3. Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized when disciplinary action, in Table 5-22, is taken against a Service member stationed OCONUS whose dependent resides in the CONUS.

HHG Transportation before an Order Is Issued 1. HHG transportation before a PCS order is issued is authorized if the request for transportation is supported by all of the following: a. A statement from the AO or designated representative that the Service member was advised before such an order was issued that it would be issued. b. A written agreement, signed by the applicant, to pay any additional costs incurred for transportation to another point required because the new PDS named in the order is different than that named in the AO\u2019s statement. c. A written agreement, signed by the applicant, to pay the entire transportation cost if a PCS order is not later issued to authorize the transportation. 2. The length of time before the PCS order is issued, during which a Service member may be advised that an order will be issued, is limited to the relatively short period between the time when a determination is made to order the Service member to make a PCS and the date the order is actually issued. 3. HHG transportation before a PCS order is issued is authorized for a Service member assigned to a ship that has been scheduled for an overhaul, if the AO or designated representative provides a statement that the ship\u2019s home port is to be changed due to the overhaul. This statement may be issued when there are fewer than 90 days between the time when a specific overhaul site is determined and the actual ship\u2019s departure to the overhaul site. If the scheduled ship overhaul is canceled, HHG must be transported to the proper destination at Government expense (59 Comp. Gen. 509 (1980)). 4. General information furnished to the Service member concerning order issuance before the determination is made to actually issue the order (such as time of eventual release from active duty, time of service term expiration, eligibility date for retirement, or expected rotation date from duty OCONUS) is not advice that the order is to be issued and cannot be used as a reason to transport HHG 03/01/2025 5C-2 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B before the PCS order is issued (52 Comp. Gen. 769 (1973)). C. Time Limitation. Unless otherwise specified in the JTR, a Service member\u2019s HHG transportation authority may be used any time while the order remains in effect and before receipt of another PCS order, as long as the HHG transportation is due to the Service member\u2019s PCS rather than for personal reasons (45 Comp.

This limit was effective May 2014, and cannot be waived or increased except as specified below. a. A Service member may exceed the 2,000 pound weight limit when returning from outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or executing a consecutive overseas tour (COT) if orders OCONUS were issued before May 1, 2014. b. PBP&E over 2,000 pounds must have been originally shipped at Government expense to the location OCONUS. The Service member may ship the same amount of PBP&E that was originally shipped OCONUS. 2.

The weight allowance for a Service member authorized in this table is the total combined weight of any HHG shipped, plus any unaccompanied baggage shipped, and any HHG in storage. See PDT computation example 11. 1. The weight of PBP&E, required medical equipment, and gun safes are not included in the HHG weight allowance authorized. See par. 051304 for details on PBP&E, required medical equipment, and gun safes. 2. The weight of accompanied baggage or excess accompanied baggage is also not included in the authorized weight allowance. B. Dependent Eligible to Travel. For Table 5-37, a Service member with dependents is one who has a dependent eligible to travel at Government expense due to a PCS, regardless if the dependent actually travels. For a Service member\u2019s first PCS after either the death of all of the Service member\u2019s dependents, or a divorce that leaves the Service member with no dependents eligible to travel at Government expense, the Service member\u2019s weight allowance remains at the with-dependent rate. C. Pay Grade Determination. A Service member appointed from either an enlisted or warrant officer pay grade to a commissioned officer pay grade, or from an enlisted pay grade to a warrant officer pay grade, is authorized the greater of the weight allowance for the pay grade held on the effective date of the PCS order or for the pay grade held when the appointment was accepted. If the Service member\u2019s pay grade reverts to the prior pay grade, then he or she is authorized the greater of those two weight allowances. D. Special Senior Enlisted Service Members. A Service member selected as Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sergeant Major of the Army, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, or Senior Enlisted Advisor to the National Guard Bureau is authorized a weight allowance of 17,000 pounds with dependents or 14,000 pounds without dependents for a PCS order issued on or after receiving notice of selection to that position. The Service member is authorized these weight allowances for the remainder of his or her military career. Table 5-37.

Administrative Weight Limitations 1. The weight allowances can be administratively restricted at a PDS OCONUS based on factors at that location. Such factors include whether HHG is supplied at the PDS, if there is limited space for HHG in Government quarters or private-sector housing, and if there is limited storage for excess HHG in the area. See Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations. 2. Services establish item allowances for a specific location. Services must coordinate so that allowances are uniform for all Service members of all Services by pay grade and dependency status in the area. 3. When the new PDS location has an administrative weight limit, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation to a designated place or to NTS for the remainder of the HHG weight allowance in Table 5-37 that could not be shipped to the new PDS. B. Administrative Weight Limitations not Applicable. Administrative weight limitations do not apply to: 1. HHG shipments from non-foreign locations OCONUS to any location without an administrative weight limitation. 2. A Service member with a weight allowance of less than 2,500 pounds. 3. A Service member assigned as a COCOM Senior Defense Official/Defense Attach\u00e9, unless otherwise directed by the source agency, or if the post is identified as a Special Shipment Allowance Post.

When unpacked and uncrated HHG actual weight is not known, subtract 10% of the net weight shown on the shipping documents. See PDT computation example 19 and PDT computation example 20. Subtract 50% from the gross weight shown on the shipping document. When only the loaded-container gross weight and shipping container weights are known, subtract 20% from the difference between the loaded container gross weight and the empty container stenciled weight. When only the shipment gross weight is shown on the shipping document, reduce the gross weight by 50%. Subtract 50% from the weight upon which transportation charges are based.

The Service member or next of kin, when appropriate, who personally arranges for HHG transportation without going through a Government transportation office is responsible for all issues and costs related to any of the following: 1. The Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) if the transportation is to or from a location OCONUS. 2. The use of U.S. flag carriers, import and export processes, tariffs, customs, and, if Service regulations require their use, any available Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers. 3. HHG transportation costs paid by a third party. The Service member or next of kin is not reimbursed for costs paid by a third party. B. Government Transportation Office not Available. When the Service member personally arranges HHG transportation or NTS because either a Transportation Office is not available or a Transportation Officer instructs the Service member in writing to arrange transportation or storage at personal expense, reimbursement is authorized as follows: 1. The actual cost of shipment up to 100% of the maximum allowable weight allowance, not including special routing and services in par. 051306-E. 2.

D. Determining Weight. The weight of HHG transported is normally established with certified weight certificates from a public weigh master or Government scales. The public weigh master is the person who issues the weight certificates. The net weight, or the Service member\u2019s authorized weight allowance, whichever is less, is used to determine the Government\u2019s constructed cost. 1. Using a constructed weight of 7 pounds per cubic foot may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process when weight certificates are not available due to one of the following reasons: a. A public scale or Government scale was not available. b. The HHG was moved commercially and the carrier or contractor was paid for the move on a basis other than weight. 2. When the carrier or contractor constructs the weight, the carrier or contractor may be requested to substantiate the reasonableness of the constructed weight. If the constructed weight is unreasonable, then the Service may base reimbursement on a reasonable weight. E. Government\u2019s Constructed Cost (GCC). The Armed Forces and NOAA use different factors in computing the GCC for HHG transportation than the USPHS does. 1. For the Armed Forces and NOAA, the GCC is determined by using the \u201cBest Value\u201d methodology for the channel and the actual HHG weight up to the Service member\u2019s authorized maximum HHG weight allowance as follows: a. For shipments within the CONUS, between the CONUS and Alaska, and within Alaska (called domestic shipments), the GCC includes the following \u201cBest Value\u201d charges: (1) Line haul, packing, and unpacking. (2) Line haul factor charges at the origin and destination. (3) Short-haul charges for shipments moving 800 or fewer miles. b. For international shipments, which include shipments to or from Hawaii and to or from U.S. territories and possessions, the GCC includes the \u201cBest Value\u201d \u201cSurface\u201d Single Factor Rate (SFR). c. Payment of accessorial charges may only be authorized or approved when charges would have been authorized during a Government-arranged move and all applicable tariff approval rules have been met. For details on how \u201cBest Value\u201d costs are determined, see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, 03/01/2025 5C-15 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B Chapter 403 (Best Value). d. For the USPHS, the GCC: (1) In the CONUS is determined by using the lowest applicable tariff rate plus the applicable packing allowance rate, and then multiplying that sum by the actual HHG weight, which is limited to the Service member\u2019s authorized maximum HHG weight.

Service members or dependents using the same POV for traveling and PPM are authorized both a PPM monetary allowance and MALT Plus as separate allowances. G. Advance of Funds. Advance payment is authorized for personally procured HHG transportation depending on the type of move the Service member chooses. An advance payment is authorized for any of the following: 1. The constructed expenses for transportation arranged when Government-procured HHG transportation or NTS is not available. 2. The constructed expenses, limited to the Government\u2019s maximum obligation, for transportation arranged when Government-procured transportation and NTS is available but the Service member personally procures the HHG transportation. 3.

Allowances. When an official announcement designates a home port change, no further HHG transportation to the current home port (also called the old home port) can be made until a new order is issued. However, if the HHG is in transit or in an otherwise irreversible transportation status on the date the home port change announcement is made, the HHG transportation to the old home port may continue.

Eligibility. When a Service member\u2019s dependent is at a PDS OCONUS, circumstances may result in the dependent returning to the CONUS before the Service member\u2019s next PCS. When a dependent is transported due to these reasons, HHG transportation may also be authorized as specified in this paragraph. These circumstances are separated into three groups: 1. Departure due to official situations. 2. Reasons of national interest. 3. Departure due to personal situations. B. Allowances. Authority for HHG transportation for a dependent and a former family member under this paragraph is in addition to, and has no effect on, the authority for HHG transportation based on dependency status and pay grade on the effective date of the Service member\u2019s next PCS order. The Service member is authorized to transport up to the full HHG weight allowance under the next PCS order. See PDT computation example 12. 1. HHG Transportation from a Foreign or Non-Foreign Location OCONUS Due to Official Situations a. When a dependent is transported to a designated place from a foreign or non-foreign location OCONUS for one of the official reasons in par. 050804, the order may also authorize HHG transportation. The HHG weight is limited to the authorized PCS weight allowance or an administrative weight limitation related to the foreign or non-foreign location OCONUS. The HHG may be transported from any location, including from NTS, to the designated place. b. If the official reason that caused the departure of the dependent is resolved or changed so that the dependent can return to the PDS OCONUS, and the AO determines that the return is in the Government\u2019s best interest, then the order authorizing the dependent\u2019s return can also authorize HHG transportation. The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining in the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS; although, the Secretarial Process may grant an exception when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of those 12 months. 2. HHG Transportation from a Location OCONUS Due to Reasons of National Interest. When the Secretary concerned or a more senior official determines that a dependent must return from a location OCONUS for reasons of national interest before the Service member\u2019s next PCS, the travel order authorizing the dependent transportation to a designated place may also authorize HHG transportation.

The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining in the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS; although, the Secretarial Process may grant an exception when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of those 12 months. 3. HHG Transportation from a Location OCONUS due to a Personal Situation. An order authorizing dependent transportation under certain circumstances due to a personal situation may also authorize HHG transportation within the authorized PCS weight allowance or within the administrative weight limitation that may apply. When authorized, HHG can be transported from any location, including NTS, to a designated place or, when granted through the Secretarial Process, to a destination in the dependent\u2019s native country if the dependent spouse is foreign born. Instead of shipping HHG, the Service member is also authorized NTS or continued NTS. HHG transportation due to personal situations must be authorized in advance of the shipment unless otherwise specified in this paragraph. a. A Service member with a dependent, on a PCS order to a new PDS OCONUS, who transports HHG to the PDS in anticipation of the dependent moving to the PDS OCONUS, may be provided return transportation for HHG if, for reasons beyond the Service member\u2019s control, the dependent does not join the Service member. The return transportation of the HHG may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process when in the best interest of the Service member or dependent and the Government. The cost of shipping the HHG is limited to the transportation cost from the PDS OCONUS to the dependent\u2019s location. b.

(2) An extension of the 6-month time limit may be authorized or approved for dependent travel in par. 050805. If the 6-month time limit is extended, the HHG must be turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier for transportation within 1 year after the effective date of the final decree of divorce or annulment or the date the Service member completes personal travel due to a PCS, whichever occurs first. e. When an order authorizes dependent transportation under par. 052009-B, HHG transportation may be authorized. The official authorizing the transportation determines the destination to which transportation is authorized and ensures that a reasonable relationship exists between the destination and the conditions and circumstances. The cost is limited to what the Government\u2019s cost would have been to transport the HHG between authorized locations. The authorized locations for the origin are the Service member\u2019s last or former PDS OCONUS, or the place to which the HHG was last transported at Government expense. The authorized destinations are the Service member\u2019s HOR or PLEAD, or the dependent\u2019s designated place. An additional authorized destination may be the foreign- born dependent\u2019s native country when granted through the Secretarial Process. NTS is not authorized.

If the Service member transports his or her HHG between locations other than those authorized, the Transportation Officer or Finance Office computes the excess costs based on either the cost that the Government would have incurred for transporting the Service member\u2019s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot from the last PDS or the cost of transporting the HHG from its actual location, whichever would result in a lower cost to the Government. 2. A Service member who is authorized HHG transportation under par. 051002 is authorized NTS. The authority begins on the date the order is issued and terminates on the end of the 180th day from the active-duty termination date. 3. SIT of the HHG transported from NTS under par. 051002 is authorized only when necessary due to conditions beyond the Service member\u2019s control that arise after HHG transportation from NTS and the SIT is authorized or approved according to Service regulations. Any HHG not placed in NTS may be placed in SIT under section 0518-A in connection with transportation under par. 051002. B. HHG Transportation and NTS\u2014Other Circumstances 1.

Eligibility. A Service member on a PCS order may be authorized mobile home transportation allowances instead of household goods (HHG) transportation at Government expense when traveling to a new PDS that is either in the CONUS or Alaska. The Service member either has no dependent or has a dependent who travels to the new PDS at the same time as the Service member. A dependent may also be eligible for mobile home allowances when he or she is authorized to travel to or from the designated place or selected point in the CONUS or Alaska to a new PDS OCONUS. A mobile home eligible for transportation must meet all of the following conditions: 1. The mobile home is acquired on or before the PCS order\u2019s effective date to use as a residence by the Service member or a dependent at the location where it is being moved. 2. The mobile home\u2019s condition is maintained (including body, chassis, tires, and tubes) to withstand the transportation rigors. Any necessary maintenance to prepare the mobile home for transportation is at either the Service member\u2019s, dependent\u2019s, or heir\u2019s expense and to the Government\u2019s satisfaction. B.

This Part implements the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), and provides Department of Defense (DoD) administrative requirements for DoD civilian employees. It also covers the eligibility for the standard PCS allowances: transportation, per diem, miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, the miscellaneous expense allowance (MEA), temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE), house-hunting trips (HHT), real estate transactions-including lease breaking expense - relocation services, Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance, privately owned vehicle (POV) shipment, and household goods (HHG) and mobile home transportation and storage. The standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 apply, unless otherwise indicated in Chapter 5. PCS allowances are authorized and limited to travel and transportation over a direct, usually traveled route between an old permanent duty station (PDS) and a new PDS, unless specified otherwise in the JTR. 0536 STANDARD PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ALLOWANCES (FTR \u00a7302-3) Civilian relocation allowances are authorized when the hiring process includes PCS allowances unless specified otherwise in the JTR. The authorized allowances are transportation for the civilian employee and dependent, per diem for the civilian employee and dependent, miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, MEA, real estate, HHG transportation and storage, and the RIT allowance. The Agency may not negotiate, deny, or reduce these allowances when the civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements. The HHT, TQSE, property management services, and transportation allowances for POV shipment are discretionary. The PCS order must indicate the specific allowances authorized for the relocation and provide instructions about procedures for travel and transportation services. Section 0536 applies when the hiring process includes PCS allowances. For travel and transportation eligibility and allowance tables, see FTR \u00a7302-3."}

Determining Factors. PCS travel and transportation allowances must be paid when it is in the Government\u2019s interest to fill a position by moving a civilian employee from one PDS to another. Case- by-case factors, such as cost-effectiveness, labor market conditions, and difficulty in filling the vacancy, form the basis for determining whether to offer PCS allowances. Budget constraints do not justify denying PCS allowances. B. Responsibilities. It is each DoD Component\u2019s responsibility to make decisions that balance a civilian employee\u2019s rights and the prudent use of appropriated funds. Before a DoD Component advertises for a vacancy, the appropriate official should determine if it is in the Government\u2019s interest to pay PCS allowances taking case-by-case factors into consideration. For example, an activity may determine that well-qualified candidates exist within a particular geographical area and restrict the recruitment area in the recruitment announcement or indicate that PCS allowances are not offered. This information should be provided in the position advertisement, but can be decided after the applicants are referred to the selecting official. C. Reason for Move. The guidelines for making a move in the Government\u2019s best interest are as follows: 1. Management-directed Moves in the Government\u2019s interest. A PCS is in the Government\u2019s best interest when a DoD Component recruits or requests a civilian employee to transfer. This is limited to relocation for a RIF, a transfer of function, a DoD Component career-development program, a DoD Component-directed placement, or another reason that the transfer is in the Government\u2019s interest. 2. PCS Moves not in the Government\u2019s Interest. If a civilian employee pursues, solicits, or requests a position change resulting in a geographic move from one PDS to another, the transfer is for the civilian employee\u2019s convenience and benefit, not in the Government\u2019s interest. In that case, the gaining activity must formally advise the civilian employee, at the time it extends an offer, that the transfer is in the civilian employee\u2019s interest, not in the Government\u2019s interest, and that the Government does not pay the PCS expenses. A civilian employee responding to a vacancy request is not pursuing, soliciting, or requesting a position change. D. Notification. Travel and transportation allowances do not tie automatically to a Merit Promotion Program vacancy announcement. The appropriate official must document any decision against paying PCS allowances in writing. The organization must notify in writing all applicants selected for interview of its decision whether to pay PCS allowances. If the organization does not hold interviews, it 03/01/2025 5F-9 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B must inform the selected applicant, in writing, whether it will pay PCS allowances."}

Move Frequency. It is neither cost effective nor efficient to provide more than one PCS move to a DoD civilian employee during any 12-month period. A transfer within the DoD at Government expense may not be authorized within 12 months of the civilian employee\u2019s most recent PCS unless the AO certifies that the proposed transfer is in the Government\u2019s interest, an equally qualified civilian employee is not available within the commuting area of the activity concerned, and the losing activity agrees to the transfer. This policy does not preclude a civilian employee from accepting a position, but it may cause the civilian employee to relocate at personal expense. The following moves are exceptions to the 12-month period limitation: 1. A civilian employee or re-employed former civilian employee affected by a RIF or transfer of functions (see par. 054805). 2. A DoD Component directed placement. 3. From the actual residence to a new PDS, after the civilian employee exercises return transportation rights from a PDS OCONUS under a tour agreement OCONUS, but only if the civilian employee did not receive PCS allowances for the return to actual residence. A civilian employee who signed a new service agreement for return to actual residence and received TQSE or MEA reimbursements has received PCS allowances. B. Successive PCS Moves. When a civilian employee makes successive PCS moves and dependent or HHG movement is delayed until transfer to the last PDS, movement is allowed by the direct route between the first and last PDSs, provided the 1-year time limitation under the authority for the first transfer has not expired. If the 1-year time limitation has expired for transfer from the first PDS, travel and transportation allowances are limited to those from a subsequent PDS where the 1-year time limitation has not expired to the last PDS. See par. 053713 for funding responsibility."}

All authorized PCS allowances must be used and completed within 1 year from the effective transfer or appointment date. The civilian employee is financially responsible for PCS travel and transportation allowances beyond the initial 1 year unless an extension is authorized or approved by the DoD Component as being in the Government\u2019s interest. A. Extension. The DoD Component may grant an extension, upon a civilian employee\u2019s request, only if the 1-year time limit for purchase or sale of a residence or an unexpired lease transaction was completed under par. 054501-B. Reasons that do not justify authorizing or approving an extension include, but are not limited to, delaying a dependent or HHG relocation in anticipation of a future PCS order not yet issued and residence construction or renovation delays at the new PDS. When an extension is authorized or approved, PCS allowances must be calculated by using the regulations and rates in effect on the civilian employee\u2019s transfer effective date. B. Embargoes or Shipping Restrictions. When a civilian employee is assigned to duty OCONUS 03/01/2025 5F-11 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B and travel and transportation is not feasible due to shipping restrictions, that time does not count toward the 1-year time limit. The delay required by travel restriction and administrative embargo that make dependent travel impossible is excluded from the 1-year period. Lack of family housing in an area OCONUS that prevents dependent travel is an administrative embargo. When an administrative embargo is removed, the command OCONUS must notify in writing each affected civilian employee. The remaining number of days left in the 1-year time limit when travel was impeded are all that remain allowing execution of travel and transportation allowances on the date when the embargo is removed. C. Military Duty. For a civilian employee who enters active military duty any time before the 1- year period ends, the time spent in military service is not included in the period. The 1-year period excludes furlough time spent by a civilian employee who begins active military service before the expiration of the 1-year period and who is furloughed for the military assignment duration to the PDS for which transportation and travel expenses are allowed. D. Transfers without a Break in Service. When a civilian employee of another Federal Department or Agency stationed OCONUS is transferred to a position in a DoD activity OCONUS without a break in service, dependent travel from the old PDS OCONUS to the new PDS OCONUS is authorized if the move is in the Government\u2019s best interest.

This applies to movement between any of the following: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, DoD Components, and to or from non-DoD Agencies. Except in the case of a RIF, transfer of function, or movement under the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP), costs associated with a PCS may be paid by the gaining Department, Agency, or DoD Component. 1. RIF or Transfer of Function. The losing activity must pay transfer costs between different DoD activities of a civilian employee identified for separation or demotion caused by RIF or transfer of function. A losing DoD activity must request that the non-DoD gaining activity pay or share the costs for transfers that involve a RIF or transfer of function to a Department or Agency outside DoD.

Eligibility. An AO may authorize a TCS with limited PCS allowances, instead of TDY allowances, for a civilian employee scheduled for a long-term TDY not less than 6 months or more than 30 months. An AO may authorize a TCS only when it is expected to last 6 months or more. The TCS location is the civilian employee\u2019s temporary official duty location. If the assignment ends sooner than 6 months, for reasons other than separation from Government service, TCS expenses are paid. If the assignment is more than 30 months, the civilian employee must be permanently assigned to the temporary official location or returned to the previous official location. A TCS assignment may be considered only if the civilian employee is directed to perform a long-term TDY at another duty location outside the local area as defined in section 0206. No minimum distance between a PDS and TCS location is required to qualify for a TCS. A Service agreement is not required for a TCS move. B. Ineligible Civilian Employees.

Together, the total weight of HHG stored and the weight of HHG transported must not be greater than the maximum 18,000 pounds. The civilian employee is personally financially responsible for all excess costs if the total weight of stored and transported HHG is greater than the maximum allowed. b. Property Management Services. Property management services may be authorized only for a residence at the civilian employee\u2019s PDS in the CONUS or a non-foreign PDS OCONUS from which the civilian employee was assigned to the TCS location. 03/01/2025 5F-17 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B 2.

MALT is based on the official distance in par. 020204, when traveling on a PCS order between any of the official points in Table 2-2. A rental car used for PCS travel is considered a POV. Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing MALT. The MALT rate in effect on the date PCS travel commences applies even if travel is completed after the rate changes. See Chapter 2 for POV use to or from a transportation terminal or PDS, or miscellaneous reimbursable expenses associated with POV transportation. A. Automobile Use. Automobile use is to the government\u2019s advantage for first duty station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel. Automobile use by a dependent is to the Government\u2019s advantage for PCS travel, other than transoceanic. B. Privately Owned Motorcycle. The use of a privately owned motorcycle for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government\u2019s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation. Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day. C. Privately Owned Airplane 1. The use of a privately owned airplane for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government\u2019s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation. Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day. 2. Nautical miles must be converted to statute miles. One nautical mile equals 1.15077945 statute miles, so that 250 nautical miles multiplied by 1.15077945 equals 288 statute miles. 3. Reimbursement for travel by privately owned airplane is at the appropriate TDY mileage rate. D. Privately Owned Aircraft Other than Airplane. The actual operation cost is reimbursed instead of a commuted rate mileage. The following expenses are reimbursable: fuel, oil, and aircraft parking, landing, and tie-down fees. The following expenses are not reimbursable: charges for repairs, depreciation, replacements, grease, oil change, antifreeze, towage, and similar expenses. E. Transoceanic Travel by POV. An AO may authorize a civilian employee or dependent to use a POV on a route normally involving transoceanic travel if it is more advantageous to the Government.

Travel to and from the vehicle processing centers (VPC), when concurrent with the en route travel. B. Transoceanic Travel. When transoceanic travel is involved between to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS, air transportation is the normally authorized transportation mode for transoceanic travel for both the civilian employee and any dependents. For POV travel, see par. 053802-E. A dependent is required to use Government transportation when it is reasonably available and directed. However, the dependent must not be required to use other than regularly scheduled transport type aircraft, such as Patriot Express or Category B AMC transportation, ordinarily used for passenger service. When appropriate Government air transportation is available and travel by aircraft has not been determined medically inadvisable but a dependent travels at personal expense no reimbursement is authorized. C. Concurrent Travel. Concurrent dependent travel from the CONUS is authorized to specific areas OCONUS (see Table 5-67). For a civilian employee on a PCS order to a dependent-restricted tour, see par. 053704. When prior command approval OCONUS is necessary, the recruiting office in the CONUS or other appropriate office must obtain concurrent travel authority from the command OCONUS and advise the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee. When dependent travel is authorized concurrently with the civilian employee or within 60 days after the civilian employee\u2019s reporting date at the Army, Navy, or Air Force transportation terminal in the CONUS, the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee must take action regarding the dependent\u2019s passport, visas, immunizations or inoculations, port calls, and transportation. When dependent travel, initially prohibited, is authorized by the command OCONUS subsequent to the civilian employee\u2019s arrival at the PDS OCONUS, the civilian employee\u2019s travel order must be amended to note the authority for dependent travel at that time.

An HHT is a discretionary allowance authorized on a case-by-case basis, when a civilian employee has accepted a permanent transfer, and the circumstances indicate the need. The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if an HHT is necessary. The HHT trip duration, including travel time, is limited to 10 days.

A civilian employee is in a travel status while performing HHT during the authorized absence period."}

For a civilian employee to be authorized an HHT for PCS, both the old PDS and new PDS must be located within the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS, and be 75 or more miles apart by a usually traveled surface route according to the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD). HHT may not be authorized for any of the following reasons: 1. To assist a civilian employee in deciding whether or not to accept a transfer. 2.

If the civilian employee is at a training location in section 0326 and is authorized dependent or HHG transportation. B. AO Considerations. The AO must determine whether the HHT will be reimbursed using the Lodging Plus method or a lump sum, the appropriate HHT duration, and the authorized transportation modes to and from the new PDS location, and for local travel while house hunting. An AO must minimize HHT allowances or not authorize them when other satisfactory and more economical alternatives are available. The DoD Component may avoid or shorten the HHT duration by providing assistance and information to a civilian employee concerning housing conditions and markets at the new PDS location. The AO must consider the following factors before authorizing HHT: 1. Arranging a Permanent Residence before a Move. If the civilian employee has a large family and must promptly vacate the residence at the old PDS, it might be less costly to the Government, as well as more convenient to the civilian employee, to complete arrangements for a new residence before the move actually takes place. 2. Arranging a Permanent Residence while in Temporary Lodging. If the civilian employee has no family or a small family, it might be less costly to allow the civilian employee and family to remain in temporary lodging at the new PDS for a somewhat longer period than might otherwise be authorized, subject to TQSE limitations, until the civilian employee finds a permanent residence. 3. Avoiding an Advance Trip. If TQSE is authorized, an HHT may possibly be avoided. It might be more advantageous to the Government and the civilian employee for the civilian employee\u2019s dependents to remain at the former residence while the civilian employee occupies temporary lodging at the new PDS.

A. Lodging Plus. HHT subsistence expenses are ordinarily reimbursed under the Lodging Plus method. Compute per diem for one round trip for the civilian employee, spouse, or both, in accordance with par. 053901. For a HHT in the CONUS, use the Standard CONUS per diem rate. For a HHT in non-foreign OCONUS, use the locality per diem rate (CBCA 5091-RELO, March 22, 2016). When the civilian employee and spouse travel together on an HHT, the per diem rate for the spouse is 75% of the civilian employee\u2019s per diem rate. A civilian employee paid per diem using the Lodging Plus method must itemize lodging expenses and retain lodging receipts. B. Lump Sum. A DoD Component may offer to pay a lump sum for subsistence expenses. Once the civilian employee signs a service agreement and accepts the HHT (Lump Sum) offer, then HHT (Lump Sum) is irrevocable. A civilian employee paid for an HHT using the lump-sum method does not require itemization, receipts for payment, or a cost comparison.

A civilian employee transporting an exotic pet is required by law to have a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) certification before transporting the pet to or from foreign locations, and should contact the FWS before transporting the pet. A. Reimbursable Pet Expenses. Cat and dog transportation and quarantine charges are not a separately reimbursable expense but may be claimed as MEA, only when claiming actual expenses for MEA. B. Non-reimbursable Pet Expenses. Non-transportation and handling pet-related expenses are not reimbursable. See the DTMO website for details on these expenses. When a traveler does not use a City Pair Program airfare because a pet cannot travel on the same aircraft, the Government is not financially responsible for costs greater than the most economical travel routing.

The General Services Administration (GSA) issued a final rule amending the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) with respect to temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE) allowances. Changes include implementing a third TQSE methodology, redefining the current TQSE methods, lowering the percentage multipliers for calculating TQSE maximum daily amounts, and prohibiting adjustments to TQSE percentage multipliers for househunting days. The final rule also exempts temporary quarters (TQ) located in Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas under the Stafford Act from the \u2018\u2018reasonable proximity\u2019\u2019 requirement and allows agencies to authorize TQSE at the applicable locality per diem allowance or authorize actual expenses on an individual basis. (See FTR Case 2022-02). These changes are applicable for relocations authorized after June 30, 2024. B. TQSE is a discretionary, not mandatory, allowance unless a civilian employee returns from a foreign area through the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). The civilian employee may be authorized TQSE for a TCS. TQSE may be authorized in addition to COLA payable under the DSSR (5 U.S.C. \u00a75941) and any BAH, OHA, or Basic Allowance for Subsistence paid to a Uniformed Services member who is the spouse or domestic partner of a civilian employee authorized PCS expenses and allowances. TQSE may also be paid in addition to Temporary Lodging Allowance (see DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol. 7A), or TLE (see section 0505) as long as payments cover different expenses. Duplication of allowances is not authorized. TQSE is not paid when the civilian employee is receiving other subsistence expense allowances (FTR \u00a7302-6.16). Subsistence expenses are the expenses for lodging, food, and other necessities incurred while occupying temporary lodging for a PCS move. \u2026continued"}

Inability to locate permanent private-sector housing adequate for family needs due to housing conditions at the new PDS. d. Sudden illness, injury, or death of the civilian employee or of an immediate family member. B. Occupancy Time Frames. The occupancy period for temporary lodging runs concurrently for the civilian employee and all dependents. The civilian employee may occupy temporary lodging at one location while a dependent occupies temporary lodging at another location. If a civilian employee moves HHG into temporary lodging occupied initially at a new PDS and continues occupancy indefinitely, the temporary lodging is considered \u201cpermanent private-sector housing\u201d starting on the date the HHG is delivered. However, the AO may determine it is still \u201ctemporary lodging\u201d after considering lease duration, HHG movement into the lodging, lodging type, expressions of intent, attempts to secure permanent private-sector housing, and how long the civilian employee occupied the lodging. 1. Starting Occupancy. Temporary lodging occupancy may start as soon as the civilian employee has signed a service agreement and TQSE allowances have been authorized in a PCS order. TQSE must begin within 1 year after the civilian employee\u2019s effective date of transfer, unless that time is extended in par. 053712. 2. Occupancy Interruptions a. Once TQSE (LP) begins, the period continuously runs uninterrupted until the civilian employee or any dependent occupies permanent lodging or the authorized time period ends. Events that interrupt the TQSE (LP) continuous period are: (1) Actual travel time for travel between the old PDS and new PDS. (2) Necessary official duties, such as an intervening TDY or military duty. (3) Non-official necessary interruptions, such as hospitalization. (4) Approved sick leave but not annual leave. b. Other reasons beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control interrupt the continuous period if acceptable to the AO. c. When official travel interrupts occupancy of temporary lodging, the actual time en route, limited to the authorized allowable travel time, is excluded from the eligibility period, which resumes when temporary lodging is reoccupied. The time period continues to run if a dependent occupies temporary lodging at the civilian employee\u2019s new PDS, or another location, during the civilian employee\u2019s TDY or military duty training assignment. When a civilian employee retains temporary lodging while on a TDY, the cost is reimbursed as part of the TQSE (LP) allowance (in addition to per diem received for the TDY) if the AO determines that the civilian employee acted reasonably in retaining the temporary lodging. d.

TQSE eligibility continues for the remainder of the authorized time, if necessary. 3. Ending Occupancy. Temporary lodging occupancy ends when the civilian employee or a dependent occupies permanent private-sector housing or the authorized time period expires, whichever occurs first. C. Receipts and Supporting Statement. Receipts and a written supporting statement must accompany a TQSE (LP) claim. Use DD Form 2912, \u201cClaim for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense (TQSE),\u201d to document TQSE expenses for reimbursement. 1. Receipts. Receipts are required for lodging costs paid and must show the location, dates, and who occupied the lodging. Lodging taxes and other subsistence expenses of $75 or more requires a receipt. There is no requirement to document M&IE. 2. Supporting Statement. The supporting statement must include: a. Travel status and temporary lodging occupancy (for subsistence expense purposes) that occur the same day, the date, and the arrival and departure times at the temporary lodging location. b. The date that permanent private-sector housing occupancy starts or the date that HHG is moved into permanent private-sector housing. c. The amount of lodging paid for each day. D. Conditions Affecting Reimbursement 1. Partial Days of TQSE (LP). Temporary lodging occupancy for less than a whole calendar day is the same as 1 full calendar day for TQSE (LP) reimbursement. 2. En Route Travel. Reimbursement may not be paid under both TQSE (LP) and another subsistence expense allowance within the same calendar day, unless TQSE (LP) is claimed on the same day that en route travel per diem ends. In this case, compute en route travel per diem under applicable partial-day rules and claim TQSE (LP) reimbursement for expenses incurred after 1800 (6 p.m.) on that day. Par. 054205 explains limitations on duplication of allowances. 3. Temporary Lodging Occupancy in All Other Cases. The TQSE (LP) period starts at 0001 of the calendar day that TQSE (LP) reimbursement is claimed, provided temporary lodging is occupied during that calendar day. 4. TQSE (LP) Period Termination. The temporary lodging period ends at 2400 on either the day before the civilian employee or his or her dependents occupies permanent residence quarters, or the day that authorized TQSE expires, whichever occurs first. 5. Meal Preparation in Temporary Lodging.

A traveler who lodges with a friend or relative is authorized the appropriate M&IE rate, if otherwise eligible. 7. Allowable Expenses when an Apartment, House, Mobile Home or Recreational Vehicle Is Rented or Used for Lodging a. When a civilian employee on PCS at the old or new PDS rents commercial or private lodging, a furnished or unfurnished apartment, house, mobile home, or recreational vehicle for use as lodging, TQSE (LP) lodging expenses are computed according to par. 020303. Any lodging, apartment, house, or mobile home that is already or will become the PDS permanent residence cannot also be used as a temporary residence. b. To calculate the reimbursement amount, determine the daily TQSE (LP) lodging rate and prorate the total allowable expenses used by the number of TQSE (LP) days used then compare the actual daily TQSE (LP) lodging cost against the locality\u2019s daily lodging rate and pay the lesser amount. 8. Reimbursement Limitation when Purchasing a Mobile Home. TQSE (LP) expenses are limited to the temporary expenses listed in par. 020303 when a mobile home is purchased as a temporary residence and used while seeking a primary residence at the new PDS other than the mobile home being used as temporary lodging. Real estate expenses, such as mortgage or interest fees, are not authorized. If the civilian employee\u2019s primary residence is already or will become the home used as a temporary residence, TQSE is not authorized. 9. HHT and TQSE (LP) a. When the AO authorizes TQSE (LP), they must also consider if an HHT will be authorized and reduce the number of authorized TQSE days by the number of authorized HHT days. The percentage multiplier used for calculating TQSE (LP) cannot be reduced based on the number of days used for an HHT. b. To illustrate how AOs should consider HHT and TQSE (LP), an example is provided below. Additional examples are on the DTMO website. TQSE (LP) and authorizes 10 days of HHT.

When the AO authorizes a time extension of TQSE (LP) for temporary lodging occupancy beyond the first 60 days, the additional days must be computed at the reduced rates as specified in Table 5-85a. F. Denying Reimbursement. The AO may deny reimbursement of any claimed TQSE lodging expenses that appear to be unreasonable if the traveler cannot justify the expenses when TQSE (LP) is being paid. The lack of adequate documentation for the questionable TQSE period does not prohibit 03/01/2025 5F-45 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B reimbursement for the remaining TQSE days nor does the Tainted Day rule apply. The Tainted Day rule applies only when there is reasonable suspicion of fraud supported by evidence sufficient to overcome the usual presumption of honesty and fair dealing by the civilian employee. The Tainted Day rule would void the TQSE (LP) claim in its entirety when any authorized TQSE day is tainted for fraudulent expenses. G. TQSE (LP) Advance. A TQSE (LP) advance may be paid to cover the estimated expenses for up to 30 days. The DoD Component may subsequently pay additional travel advances for periods up to 30 days, limited to the maximum TQSE (LP) period. H. Miscellaneous Expenses. Temporary lodging taxes are a separately reimbursable TQSE (LP) miscellaneous expense."}

The applicable per diem rate is the rate prescribed for the locality and season when the civilian employee occupies temporary lodging. If new per diem rates are prescribed for a locality after an offer, but before travel, the AO must use the rates that were in effect when the civilian employee accepted the TQSE (LS) offer. See Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense Lump Sum (TQSE(LS)) Computation for examples of how to calculate a TQSE (LS) payment amount. The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE is offered and the number of days necessary, limited to 30 days. A. AO Considerations. The following factors must be considered before authorizing TQSE (LS): 1. Ease of Administration. TQSE (LS) does not require the review of claims, receipts, and supporting statements for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount because receipts and supporting statements are not required. The civilian employee is paid before the occupancy of temporary lodging, eliminating the after-the-fact voucher process. 2. Cost. The AO should compare the cost of TQSE (LS) to the cost of TQSE (LP). 3. Civilian Employee Choice. If the AO offers a civilian employee TQSE (LS) option, the civilian employee must choose between TQSE (LS) and TQSE (LP) and the travel order must document that decision. The TQSE (LS) option is only an offer and the civilian employee is not obligated to accept it. A civilian employee may decline the TQSE (LS) offer and choose to be reimbursed by TQSE (LP). B. Payment Limitations 1. Temporary lodging must be occupied for TQSE (LS) to be paid. 2. The civilian employee must sign a statement, which must be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that he or she will occupy temporary lodging and incur TQSE expenses. If temporary lodging is not occupied and no expense was incurred, the civilian employee must return the TQSE (LS) payment. 3. The number of days offered for TQSE (LS) is prospective and must be established in advance. TQSE (LS) cannot be authorized for more than 30 days under any circumstances. 4. Once TQSE (LS) is selected, the civilian employee may not be paid any additional TQSE if the TQSE (LS) is inadequate to cover temporary living expenses. The fixed-payment amount does not 03/01/2025 5F-46 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B change for any revised PDS per diem rates effective after the date the civilian employee accepts the offer. 5. Although receipts and supporting documentation are not required for TQSE (LS) payment, the civilian employee should retain lodging receipts or other proof that temporary lodging was occupied for at least 1 night in case the AO requests proof. Without sufficient proof, the Service or Agency may require TQSE (LS) repayment. 6. If the TQSE (LS) is greater than the amount necessary to cover the civilian \u2026continued"}

Without sufficient proof, the Service or Agency may require TQSE (LS) repayment. 6. If the TQSE (LS) is greater than the amount necessary to cover the civilian employee\u2019s TQSE expenses, any balance belongs to the civilian employee as long as temporary lodging was occupied, even if the lodging was occupied for fewer days than authorized. C. Time Limitation. The Service or Agency cannot impose limitations on the TQSE (LS) start date. D. Erroneous Advice. Erroneous advice provided by Government officials is not a basis for reimbursement. A civilian employee may not be paid for additional days beyond those originally authorized, even if he or she erroneously inferred or was told that TQSE (LS) would continue beyond 30 days. E. Computation Rules 1. HHT. The number of days paid or reimbursed for an HHT (Lump Sum) or HHT (Lodging Plus Method) are not deducted from the number of days authorized for TQSE (LS). TQSE (LS) is paid for the number of days authorized, not the number of days temporary lodging was occupied. 2. Number of People. TQSE (LS) payment is based on the civilian employee and number of dependents actually moving to the new PDS, not those who actually occupy the temporary lodging. If payment was initially made for more dependents than actually move to the new PDS, then the civilian employee must pay back the TQSE (LS) paid for any dependent who did not move. 3. Per Diem Rate. The per diem rate used for TQSE (LS) payment is the maximum locality per diem rate at either the old or new PDS. 4. Computation. Table 5-86 specifies the steps for determining TQSE (LS). Table 5-86. Computations for Determining TQSE (LS) Amount Civilian Employee, Unaccompanied Spouse, or Domestic Partner Dependent 1 2 3 Multiply the locality per diem rate by 75% to compute the daily rate. Then, multiply the daily rate by the number of days authorized. Multiply the locality per diem rate by 25% to compute the daily rate. Then, multiply the daily amount by the number of days authorized.

This does not include pads, chains, dollies, and other equipment needed to load and secure the shipment. C. Excess Charges for HHG Transportation. Erroneous advice, or lack of advice, by or from a Government civilian employee or representative does not create an entitlement to reimbursement for or shipment of HHG in excess of the weight allowed by statute. When an excess weight status is known or suspected before transportation, such as based on observations made during a pre-move survey, the Transportation Officer must notify the civilian employee and the AO providing transportation funds. 1. Government\u2019s Responsibility. The Government must pay the total transportation cost and other charges applicable to any excess weight greater than a civilian employee\u2019s weight allowance and collect reimbursement from the civilian employee. A Service or Agency may not pay the cost of transporting a civilian employee\u2019s HHG above the maximum weight. Review all transportation costs when determining excess costs, including storage (non-temporary or in transit) accessorial charges, and any other costs that the Government paid to move the HHG. 2. Civilian Employee\u2019s Responsibility. The civilian employee is financially responsible for all excess weight charges associated with shipments heavier than the authorized weight allowance, even if the excess-weight status was known or suspected before transportation and the Transportation Officer did not notify the civilian employee or the AO providing transportation funds of the weight status. Once HHG has arrived at its destination, the Service concerned determines the amount of the extra costs that the civilian employee must pay. When HHG is weighed twice, the lesser weight is used to determine the civilian employee\u2019s financial liability. The civilian employee must pay for excess charges according to finance regulations. 3. Excess Weight beyond Civilian Employee\u2019s Control. If it is determined that, for reasons beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control, the use of heavy packing and crating materials caused the computed HHG net weight for crated HHG to be greater than the allowed weight, the facts must be fully documented and the case forwarded through the following channels with recommendations for an adjustment: a.

HHG Shipment between PDSs in the CONUS. HHG shipments in the CONUS are authorized between the civilian employee\u2019s old PDS and new PDS. However, the civilian employee may select another location for the origin or destination, or ship HHG partially from the old PDS or to the new PDS. The Government\u2019s cost obligation is limited to the \u201cBest Value\u201d costs between the old PDS and new PDS. When the travel is to a first PDS, the Government\u2019s cost is limited to the transportation cost from the actual residence at the time of appointment to the PDS by a usually traveled route. 2. HHG Transportation to and between PDSs OCONUS. HHG transportation OCONUS may be authorized between the same points as dependent movement in par. 053703. When the authorized maximum HHG weight allowance is not shipped to the PDS OCONUS during the initial tour of duty, the civilian employee may be authorized transportation of the HHG balance through a renewal agreement for an additional tour of duty at the same or different PDS OCONUS. The civilian employee is financially responsible for HHG transportation costs greater than the authorized weight limit. 3. HHG Transportation from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS. HHG transportation to the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence, wherever located at the time of the assignment OCONUS, may be authorized when a civilian employee located OCONUS is authorized travel and transportation allowances at Government expense for a PCS, separation, or early return of dependent (ERD). a. The advance return transportation of all or any part of a civilian employee\u2019s HHG at Government expense, while the civilian employee remains assigned at a PDS OCONUS, is authorized only in connection with and under the same conditions as an early return of a dependent (ERD). The Government may reimburse the authorized costs of advanced HHG transportation (even if there was no advance return of a dependent) when the civilian employee has earned return travel and transportation allowances and an official PCS order directs the civilian employee\u2019s PCS or separation travel. Reimbursement of the civilian employee\u2019s transportation costs is limited to the Government\u2019s cost to transport the HHG at the time of the civilian employee\u2019s actual return travel. b. Advance HHG transportation at Government expense is not authorized unless the civilian employee has earned eligibility for return transportation by completing an agreed service period or advance return travel has been authorized for the civilian employee\u2019s dependent as being in the Government\u2019s interest.

If the civilian employee has not completed an agreed period of service, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the advance HHG transportation. Government transportation facilities may not be used for unauthorized advance HHG transportation. c. HHG of a civilian employee returning for separation may be transported at Government expense from the PDS OCONUS, NTS location, or both to the actual residence in the civilian employee\u2019s service agreement. HHG, including PBP&E, transportation may be to any alternate destination, but reimbursement is limited to the Government\u2019s constructed cost of transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence in the civilian employee\u2019s service agreement. This also applies when a civilian employee retires at the PDS OCONUS. The civilian employee is financially responsible for any excess cost. PBP&E transported as an administrative expense to a location OCONUS may be returned as an administrative expense to a civilian employee\u2019s actual residence for a civilian employee separating from Government service. d. During an evacuation, HHG transportation may be authorized at Government expense to the same location designated for a dependent\u2019s evacuation. If it is necessary and practical, HHG may be transported later at Government expense to the evacuated civilian employee\u2019s assigned PDS. 03/01/2025 5F-55 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B B. Items of Extraordinary Value. Items of extraordinary value may be transported by an expedited mode that provides satisfactory service at the \u201cBest Value\u201d to the Government, and may not be counted as unaccompanied baggage. Examples include articles of gold and other precious metals, jewels, valuable art, rare and costly collections, and items of substantial value ordinarily worn or carried, such as cameras and accessories, binoculars, jewelry, including costume jewelry, that are prone to being stolen. Items that are irreplaceable or have extreme financial or sentimental value do not receive special security though the civilian employee may purchase extra-value insurance. The net weight of such shipments is charged against the civilian employee\u2019s weight allowance. C. Reshipment of HHG. HHG returned to the CONUS or the actual residence and then reshipped back to a PDS OCONUS during a continuous employment period OCONUS do not require a new service agreement. The reasons for re-transportation of the same HHG must be beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control and the Headquarters of the DoD Service or Agency concerned must authorize or approve the re-transportation. D. Time Limitation. The time limit for HHG transportation, including when successive PCS assignments are involved (see par. 053706-B), is 1 year from the civilian employee\u2019s reporting date at the new PDS unless extended due to an extension of the real estate allowance or lease-termination transaction. 1.

If HHG transportation OCONUS is delayed, subsequent HHG transportation must not be authorized unless at least 1 year remains on the civilian employee\u2019s current service agreement or the civilian employee agrees to serve at least 1 year after the HHG arrives OCONUS. Both Adak and Kodiak, Alaska, must serve at least 6 months rather than 1-year. 2. From a PDS OCONUS. HHG transportation from the area OCONUS must begin as soon as practicable after the effective date of the civilian employee\u2019s PCS or return for separation. If practicable, HHG transportation should be concurrent with the civilian employee\u2019s departure or as soon afterward when appropriate transportation becomes available. Under no circumstances can HHG transportation occur later than 1 year after the effective date of a new PDS reassignment, excluding any time that administrative embargoes or shipping restrictions make the transportation impossible. When a civilian employee returns from an assignment OCONUS for separation, the following conditions apply: a. A civilian employee forfeits an HHG transportation allowance, including PBP&E transportation, if he or she does not use it within 1 year after the effective date of the separation. b. Upon a written request from the civilian employee or a surviving dependent, the activity\u2019s commanding officer OCONUS may authorize delayed HHG transportation from the area OCONUS, but a delayed shipment must be transported within 1 year after the effective date of the separation. c. HHG transportation from storage is authorized to the final destination if the shipment is transported within 1 year of the effective date of the civilian employee\u2019s separation. d. SIT of HHG is limited to 90 or fewer days. Upon a civilian employee\u2019s written request, the AO may authorize an additional period limited to 90 or fewer days. See par. 054307 for details on SIT. E. Transportation Methods 1. Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is part of the total HHG weight 03/01/2025 5F-56 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B allowance. The unaccompanied baggage weight allowance is 350 pounds net weight for each adult and dependent age 12 or older and 175 pounds net weight for each child under age 12. When air transportation of unaccompanied baggage is used, par. 020207 applies. Unaccompanied baggage weight allowances for air transportation include the actual weight of the luggage or packing material. a. Government transportation policy and procedures apply to transporting unaccompanied baggage, except when transporting unaccompanied baggage by an expedited mode of air transportation in par. 054305-E1b. The civilian employee or the civilian employee\u2019s agent should contact the Transportation Officer as soon as possible before travel begins to arrange unaccompanied baggage transportation. b. The total unaccompanied baggage transported by air, or any expedited mode, is limited to 1,000 pounds net weight to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS.

The total unaccompanied baggage transported by air, or any expedited mode, is limited to 1,000 pounds net weight to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS. Air transportation is not authorized when a civilian employee performs RAT, except when the additional tour of duty is served at a PDS in another area OCONUS and as authorized in par. 055006 and par. 055007. Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air from the old PDS to the appropriate port of embarkation to arrive before the civilian employee or dependent\u2019s transportation departure time. Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air when the transportation mode with the lowest \u201cBest Value\u201d cost cannot provide the required service, the civilian employee certifies the unaccompanied baggage is necessary to carry out the assigned duties, or the AO determines that expedited transportation is necessary to prevent undue hardship to the civilian employee or dependent. 2. HHG. The official designated by the Service or Agency must authorize or approve the HHG transportation method. The designated official must complete a cost comparison before authorizing a transportation method on a PCS order. The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing the cost difference between the actual expense and commuted rate methods of HHG transportation to the AO. 3. Actual Expense a. If the Government procures the HHG\u2019s transportation, it contracts, negotiates, audits, and pays the Transportation Service Provider (TSP), carrier, or vendor directly for transportation. The PCS order must state the HHG transportation authority, that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG, and that unauthorized charges are the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. Determine the Government-arranged transportation cost using the \u201cBest Value\u201d method in DTR 4500.9- R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value) for the actual HHG weight transported, limited to the maximum weight allowance. b. If the PCS order states that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG but the civilian employee personally procures the HHG transportation, then he or she must make the necessary arrangements for the HHG move and pay for the move. Reimbursement is limited to actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee, limited to the \u201cBest Value\u201d cost of a Government-arranged move for the same HHG weight. c. If actual expense HHG transportation is authorized, and the civilian employee transports HHG by Government-procured and personally-procured transportation, the combined HHG shipments cannot exceed the authorized HHG weight allowance and the cost must be lower than that of Government-procured HHG transportation of the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places. The same requirements for splitting a shipment apply when a civilian employee moves part of HHG him or herself. 03/01/2025 5F-57 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B 4. Commuted Rate (see GSA Commuted Rate Table). The civilian employee\u2019s PCS order must authorize or approve the Commuted Rate HHG transportation method.

Commuted Rate (see GSA Commuted Rate Table). The civilian employee\u2019s PCS order must authorize or approve the Commuted Rate HHG transportation method. The commuted-rate system may be used only for interstate HHG shipments between PDSs in the CONUS and is not authorized for intrastate moves. The civilian employee arranges HHG transportation other than by shipping the HHG within a mobile home. The civilian employee is authorized reimbursement under the GSA Commuted Rate for carrier services provided, including transportation, packing, unpacking, crating, drayage, and SIT. Payment under the GSA Commuted Rate is regardless of the actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee. The GSA Commuted Rate used must be in effect on the date the commercial shipper picks up the HHG, or if other than a commercial shipper is used, the date HHG begins movement. The civilian employee must furnish the actual or constructed HHG transportation weight (cubic foot measurement). A civilian employee may receive an advance for HHG transportation and SIT if authorized under the Commuted Rate. The civilian employee may not receive any reimbursement if a third party, such as a new employer, pays for the HHG transportation. 5. Civilian Employee Responsibility. A civilian employee who chooses to personally arrange for HHG transportation, whether by moving the HHG personally or by contracting directly for the HHG move, is entirely responsible for all issues related to the Status of Forces Agreement, use of U.S. carriers, import and export processes, and any tariffs, customs, or other related issues. If Service regulations require, the civilian employee must also give preference to Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers when available. 6. Limitations. The Government will only pay for HHG transportation that is within the civilian employee\u2019s authorized HHG weight allowance. The cost is limited to what the Government would have incurred for transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places, when a Government-arranged move is available. All HHG transportation must be made on U.S. flag carriers, when reasonably available. Payment on a commuted-rate basis is not authorized when the civilian employee fails to furnish the actual or constructed (cubic foot measurement) HHG transportation weight. When the civilian employee does not provide the actual or constructed weight, reimbursement is limited to the amount actually paid by the civilian employee, or the commuted-rate amount, whichever is less. The civilian employee must furnish an acceptable estimated weight statement. HHG may not be moved at Government expense when any of the following occur: a. There is no official civilian employee movement, except when the advance return of a dependent from a PDS OCONUS is authorized. b. The civilian employee violates the agreement under which the HHG originally were transported. c. The civilian employee is not authorized transportation at Government expense. d.

The AO must make a cost comparison between the actual expense and commuted rate methods of HHG transportation for each PCS order for each CONUS to CONUS PCS order. The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing the cost difference between the Actual Expense and Commuted Rate methods of HHG transportation. If the estimated costs are different by more than $100, the AO must authorize the more economical method on the PCS order. A civilian employee\u2019s request for a particular method is the determining factor if the costs are within $100 of each other. A proper cost comparison must consider line-haul transportation charges, administrative costs, and expected accessorial and packing charges. If the cost comparison is not made, or if the PCS order does not explicitly say that the actual expense method is authorized, the 03/01/2025 5F-58 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B commuted rate method applies.

Multiple Transfers. When Services or Agencies have a large volume of HHG to move between the same origin and destination at the same time, but not a mass move, multiple transfers using the Actual Expense method should be considered (see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV (Personal Property))."}

An advance is not authorized for NTS of HHG. NTS of HHG is not permitted for a career SES civilian employee for last move home. Authorization for NTS must be stated in the PCS order. A. NTS of HHG for Duty at an Isolated PDS in the CONUS. A civilian employee who performs PCS travel or new appointee travel to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is eligible for NTS of HHG. The Transportation Officer determines the NTS location. Justified requests for NTS on a PCS order to a PDS at an isolated location should be submitted to the official designated by the Service or Agency for a decision. 1. Service Agreement. Expenses for NTS of HHG at Government expense may be authorized for a civilian employee transferring to or within the CONUS when the civilian employee agrees, in writing, to remain in Government service for 12 months, beginning the date the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS. This requirement may only be waived if the civilian employee is separated for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the Service or Agency concerned. If the civilian employee violates the written service agreement, including failure to report for duty at the new PDS, any Government funds spent for NTS become the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. Follow finance regulations to recover funds due to the Government. 2. Designated Isolated PDS. An official designated by the Service or Agency must 03/01/2025 5F-59 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the location is a designated isolated PDS to authorize NTS of HHG. A civilian employee assigned to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is not allowed NTS of HHG when available housing at the PDS can accommodate the HHG, adequate housing is available within daily commuting distance, or when it is for the civilian employee\u2019s convenience. An AO may subsequently approve NTS for a PCS to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS for the conversion of HHG in SIT to NTS or the conversion of storage at personal expense to that at Government expense. An eligible civilian employee or new appointee may be authorized subsequent NTS to have an HHG portion transported to the isolated PDS and the remainder stored at Government expense. 3. Time Limit. NTS at Government expense may be authorized for the duration of the civilian employee\u2019s assignment, but no longer than 3 years at a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS.

Eligibility for NTS at Government expense ends on the last day of work at the isolated official location if that is before the end of the 3-year period. Otherwise, eligibility for NTS at Government expense ends at 3 years or on the civilian employee\u2019s last day of work at the isolated official location, whichever occurs first. When the eligibility period ends on the last day of work at the designated isolated PDS in the CONUS, NTS at Government expense may continue until the beginning of the 2nd month after the month the civilian employee\u2019s eligibility ends. To avoid inequity, the civilian employee\u2019s command may extend the NTS period for 89 or fewer days after the civilian employee\u2019s last day of work or the NTS eligibility-period termination. See examples on the DTMO website. 4. Allowable Costs. NTS includes necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, transportation to and from the storage location, storage, and other directly related services necessary to place the HHG in the designated storage facility. 5. Documentation. The Transportation Officer prepares a DD Form 1164 (Service Order for Personal Property) in accordance with the DTR, showing the HHG weight and date it was placed in NTS. B. NTS of HHG for Moves to and between Areas OCONUS. The conversion of HHG from SIT to NTS at Government expense and from storage at personal expense to NTS at Government expense may be authorized or approved in this paragraph. 1. Eligibility for NTS. At least one of the following must be true for a civilian employee to be eligible for NTS: a. The civilian employee is not authorized to transport HHG to the PDS. b. The civilian employee is unable to use HHG at the PDS. c. Storage is in the Government\u2019s best interest. d. Estimated storage cost would be less than the HHG round-trip transportation cost, including SIT, to the new PDS. 2. Time Limitation. NTS at Government expense may be authorized for each tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS where the civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements. Eligibility ends on the last day of work at the PDS. When a civilian employee is no longer eligible for NTS, HHG may remain in NTS until the beginning of the 2nd month after the month that eligibility ends. The losing command OCONUS may extend NTS at Government expense for up to 30 days before the tour of duty begins and up to 60 days after the last day of work at the PDS, limited to a total of 90 days.

See the DTMO website for examples. 3. Record Keeping a. When HHG is placed in NTS at Government expense, the Transportation Officer storing the HHG must provide one copy of the completed DD Form 1164 (Service Order for Personal Property) and any amendments, with the original warehouse inventory receipt, to both the civilian employee at his or her address OCONUS and the personnel office OCONUS servicing the civilian employee\u2019s PDS. b. The gaining personnel office OCONUS must establish a civilian employee NTS HHG file that is separate from official personnel records and serves as a suspense file for fiscal-year funding and any subsequent HHG transportation. If the civilian employee is reassigned to another PDS OCONUS, the file must be forwarded with the civilian employee\u2019s official personnel records. The gaining personnel office OCONUS also must furnish the fiscal-year fund citation to the Transportation Officer, inform the Transportation Officer if the civilian employee\u2019s NTS authority stops for any reason, and destroy the NTS file within a reasonable time after the civilian employee\u2019s PCS to the CONUS. The forms and procedures used for uniformed Service members may be used for a civilian employee\u2019s NTS as long as those forms and procedures are consistent with provisions in this Chapter. 4. Removing HHG from NTS a. A civilian employee whose HHG is in NTS at Government expense may withdraw all or any portion of the authorized HHG weight allowance from storage as long as the HHG is for a civilian employee or dependent\u2019s use in establishing or enlarging a residence. When a civilian employee\u2019s HHG is in NTS because there is no authority to transport it or he or she cannot use HHG at a PDS OCONUS, then he or she may request to withdraw HHG from NTS and transport it at Government expense if the situation requiring the NTS no longer exists and the civilian employee needs the HHG for either the current tour of duty or because he or she signs a renewal agreement. b. The Government is responsible for all costs for withdrawal, drayage, unpacking, and uncrating, as long as the HHG delivery place is in the commuting area of the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence and the JTR authorizes return transportation. HHG transportation is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility when HHG is removed from NTS before the civilian employee has eligibility for return transportation or for reasons other than for early return of a dependent (see par. 053805). When the civilian employee earns return transportation at Government expense, reimbursement for the HHG withdrawal expense must not be more than the drayage cost and related charges that would have been incurred at the \u2026continued"}

No further transportation or storage of the withdrawn HHG is authorized at Government expense before receiving a new PCS order. C. NTS of HHG for a DoD Dependents Schools (DoDDS) Civilian Employee 1. Storage between School Years. A DoDDS civilian employee separated from the rolls during the summer recess is not authorized NTS of HHG. NTS between school years may be authorized for a DoDDS civilian employee on a school-year basis under all of the following conditions: a. The DoDDS civilian employee is employed at the close of a school year and agrees, in writing, to teach the next school year. If the DoDDS civilian employee does not report for duty at the next school year, then he or she is financially responsible for commercial storage costs (including related 03/01/2025 5F-61 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B services) or value of the storage furnished (including related services) if the HHG was stored in a Government facility. If the employing activity determines that the DoDDS civilian employee\u2019s failure to report for duty was beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control, the civilian employee is not financially responsible for those costs. b. The storage period is for a minimum of 1 month and is limited to the recess period between the 2 school years. c. The DoDDS civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements for NTS. d. Storage is instead of any of the following: (1) Government quarters occupancy. (2) A quarters allowance (20 U.S.C. \u00a7905). JTR due to other employment in another position during any recess period between school years. (3) Any other HHG storage that the DoDDS civilian employee is authorized by the 2. Storage during DoDDS Civilian Employee Extended Leave. An AO may authorize or approve NTS of HHG, limited to the applicable weight allowance, during extended leave if it is in the Government\u2019s interest. The storage is limited to 12 months for a DoDDS civilian employee on an authorized extended leave of absence in a leave status, with or without pay to attend an accredited college or university as part of renewal agreement travel. An AO can authorize storage for an administrator as long as the period in the current agreement is completed rather than the 2 school years in par. 055011. An AO can rescind authorization for NTS if the DoDDS civilian employee does not report for duty at the PDS OCONUS when leave without pay ends or does not present satisfactory evidence of course of study completion. If the AO rescinds authorization for NTS, the costs become the DoDDS civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility, unless the AO \u2026continued"}

D. NTS Converted to SIT. If the Service or Agency concerned authorizes and approves, HHG may be converted from NTS to SIT, in whole or in part, if the civilian employee requests the conversion and is authorized transportation and NTS in the civilian employee\u2019s order. The conversion is of NTS to SIT is at Government expense. However, any SIT storage costs accruing for longer than 180 days are the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility.

If additional storage is not authorized or approved, the civilian employee is financially responsible for additional storage expense. 2. If an extension to the SIT time period is required, the civilian employee must submit a written request for a SIT extension to a Service- or Agency-designated official. The Service or Agency official may authorize or approve an extension for up to 90 days due to any of the following factors: a. Serious illness of the civilian employee. b. Serious illness or death of a dependent. c. An intervening TDY order or long-term training assignment. d. Lack of suitable civilian housing. e. Awaiting completion of residence under construction or renovation. f. Acts of God, national or natural disaster, or terrorism. g. Other validated circumstances beyond the civilian employee\u2019s control, which the Service or Agency determines to be in the Government\u2019s interest. B. Additional Extensions for SIT. Only PDTATAC may authorize or approve extensions of the SIT limits in Table 5-91. Under no circumstances may a Service or Agency authorize or approve SIT beyond those limits. SIT beyond the time limitations is not authorized under a TCS order. PDTATAC will consider the merits of individual requests, on a case-by-case basis, for DoD civilian employees who relocated and encountered unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, such as a PCS that is interrupted by en route TDY. PDTATAC will not authorize extensions except under the circumstances in this paragraph. 1. Authority. A GSA Waiver Memo, originally dated January 15, 2020 and extended to March 31, 2025, assigns PDTATAC the authority to grant the waiver for the time limits. The Service or Agency must ensure the extension request to PDTATAC is in the Government\u2019s interest and is not for the civilian employee\u2019s personal convenience. 2. Eligibility. The eligibility criteria for consideration of SIT authorization and approval are for any of the following: a. Serious illness or death of a civilian employee or dependent. b. A long-term TDY deployment or training assignment. c. HHG transportation delays caused by embargos. d. Acts of God, national or natural disaster, or terrorism. 03/01/2025 5F-63 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix \u2026continued"}

Time Limitations. The PDTATAC may authorize or approve extensions of the SIT period for no more than a total of 365 days. All travel and transportation must be completed within 1 year from the civilian employee\u2019s death, transfer, or appointment effective date unless a further extension is authorized under par. 053712. 4. Documentation. The civilian employee\u2019s DoD Component or command must submit an extension request to PDTATAC for determination. The DoD Component or command must include the following items for the request to be considered. a. A request memorandum from the Service or Agency to the PDTATAC indicating the reason for SIT beyond the limit, the additional number of days the employee requires, and the total estimated cost of storage for those additional days. b. Documentation demonstrating the Service or Agency\u2019s authorization and approval of the 60 or 90-day extension, including the date the household goods were placed in storage. c. Copies of any TDY or PCS orders and any relevant amendments. d. Documentation showing the weight and cost of the storage for the initial 150 or 180 days. 5. Submission Process. The civilian employee\u2019s DoD Component or command should submit the extension request through the Service\u2019s or DoD Component\u2019s Civilian Advisory Panel (CAP) member. The CAP member should submit the request package with a Storage in Transit Extension Request form. The CAP member\u2019s contact information is available at PDTATAC Contact Information. C. HHG Partial Lot Withdrawal and Delivery from SIT. HHG may be transported and stored in multiple lots. The maximum HHG weight allowance is based upon shipping and storing all HHG as one lot. If the civilian employee removes items from storage, and the carrier bills the Government for that removal, he or she is financially responsible for any excess cost to the Government. D. Funds Advance. To receive an advance under the allowed commuted rate method, the civilian employee must provide a copy of a cost estimate from a commercial HHG carrier or a written statement that includes the origin and destination. He or she must also provide a signed copy of a commercial bill of lading or other evidence of actual weight or a reasonable weight estimate acceptable to the DoD Component concerned and the anticipated period of storage at Government expense, limited to 90 days. \u2026continued"}

A POV may not be shipped as PBP&E (FTR \u00a7302-9). A. Eligibility. If it is determined before transportation that the PBP&E may cause a civilian employee to exceed the authorized weight allowance, then instead of being moved as an HHG transportation expense, PBP&E may be moved as an administrative expense under the following conditions: (FTR \u00a7302-7) 1. An official designated by the order-issuing command must review an itemized PBP&E inventory before shipment occurs. 2. The order-issuing command must determine that information furnished confirms that transporting the itemized materials as part of the HHG transportation would exceed the authorized weight allowance. 3. An appropriate official designated by the order-issuing command at the new PDS must review and certify that the items listed in the PBP&E are necessary for the proper performance of the civilian employee\u2019s duties at the new PDS. He or she must also determine that, if these items were not transported to the new PDS, the same or similar items would have to be procured at Government expense for the civilian employee\u2019s use at the new PDS. B. Weight Limitations. The maximum weight allowance for shipment of PBP&E is 2,000 pounds net weight. This limitation is not subject to waiver and is effective May 1, 2014. A civilian employee may exceed the maximum weight limit when returning from OCONUS or executing RAT if a transportation agreement to the location OCONUS was made before May 1, 2014. HHG with PBP&E greater than 2,000 pounds must have been originally shipped at Government expense to the location OCONUS. The Government\u2019s obligation to return HHG with PBP&E is limited to the amount of HHG with PBP&E initially authorized to be shipped OCONUS, including when the amount is greater than 2,000 pounds. Once the civilian employee\u2019s HHG returns to the CONUS, there is no authorization or waiver authority over the maximum weight on a subsequent transportation agreement. C. PBP&E Shipped as an Administrative Expense. When PBP&E is authorized for shipment as an administrative expense, the transportation cost is not chargeable to travel-and-transportation-expense appropriations. Transportation must be by the Actual Expense method in the CONUS and the commuted rate method is not authorized (FTR \u00a7302-7). The PBP&E weight and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be itemized on the documentation used to transport the PBP&E. A constructed weight may be used in unusual instances when it is not practicable or it is impossible to obtain the specific PBP&E weight in Table 5-87. The PBP&E may be returned as an administrative expense to any location, limited to the constructed cost to the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence when a civilian employee is separating from Government service provided the PBP&E were transported to the location OCONUS as an administrative expense (FTR \u00a7302-7).

The residence is the place from which the civilian employee regularly commutes to and from work on a daily basis. Weekend travel does not qualify. The residence may be a mobile home or the lot where that mobile home is located or will be located. It includes the dwelling where a civilian employee\u2019s dependent resides or will reside if the PDS 03/01/2025 5F-71 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B is in a remote area where adequate family housing is not available within reasonable commuting distance.

A civilian employee is reimbursed only for expenses that he or she, or a dependent, actually incurred and paid. If persons other than the civilian employee or dependent shared any expenses, reimbursement is limited to the portion actually paid by the civilian employee or dependent. If a civilian employee or dependent share title to a residence with someone else, or if a civilian employee has equitable title interest under par. 054501-D, the civilian employee is reimbursed on a pro rata basis (proportional share) to the extent of his or her actual or deemed title interest in the residence. Additionally, a civilian employee is reimbursed on a pro rata basis in the following situations: 1. The residence is a duplex or other type of multiple occupancy dwelling that is occupied only partially by the civilian employee, or whenever the civilian employee shares responsibility for a leased property (for example, a shared apartment arrangement). 2.

Following Base-Closure Announcement. A civilian employee is authorized reimbursement for real estate expenses incurred before, and in anticipation of, a transfer if administrative intent to transfer the civilian employee is evident when the expenses are incurred. The announcement of a base closure, accompanied by an offer to assist in finding a new position for an affected civilian employee, is evidence of the intent to relocate. Registering a civilian employee in the Priority Placement Program (PPP) constitutes an offer to assist in finding a new position. A civilian employee, registered in the PPP or other placement program, who sells a residence in anticipation of a PCS is authorized reimbursement for residence sale expenses when transferred to a new PDS, if otherwise eligible. Each civilian employee should be cautioned that eligibility for real estate expenses reimbursement exists only if the civilian employee is subsequently employed in a position that involves a PCS with a service agreement. If the PCS is to a foreign area, reimbursement for the expenses may be made only after the civilian employee completes a tour of duty in the foreign area and a subsequent transfer to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS in par. 054502. B. Civilian Employee Officially Notified of Return to a Different PDS in the CONUS or Non- foreign Area OCONUS. A civilian employee who is notified officially that his or her return will be to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS may sell the residence at the former PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS following receipt of official notification. Reimbursement for real estate expenses must follow section 0545 upon completion of a tour of duty in the foreign area and subsequent transfer to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS. Each civilian employee should be cautioned of the following: 1. Reimbursement is not allowed for any real estate transaction that occurs before official notification that the civilian employee\u2019s return will be to a PDS other than the one from which transferred to the foreign PDS. A travel order transferring the civilian employee from a foreign PDS to a PDS other than the one from which the civilian employee was transferred to the foreign PDS ordinarily constitutes official notification. 2. Reimbursement must not be made until the civilian employee is transferred back to a PDS in the CONUS or in a non-foreign area OCONUS. 3. Reimbursement must not be made for the transfer to the foreign-area PDS, even though the civilian employee is notified at that time that his or her return will not be to the same PDS after completing the foreign assignment. 4.

All of the following conditions must be met to determine that it is in the Government\u2019s interest for a civilian employee to have a POV at the PDS OCONUS: 1. The POV is not primarily for the civilian employee\u2019s and immediate family\u2019s convenience. 2. Local conditions make it desirable for the civilian employee to have a POV. 3.

The AO must consider commuting time and distance between the residence at the time of PCS notification and the old PDS and new PDS and the time and distance between the proposed new residence and the new PDS to determine that the residence relocation is for a PCS. B. Exception to Distance Requirement. On a case-by-case basis, the AO may authorize PCS expense reimbursement for PCS moves of less than 50 miles when the move is in the Government\u2019s interest. In addition, an exception may be authorized (for example, BRAC) through the Secretarial Process."}

A request to designate a PDS as a remote or isolated location should be submitted, with justification, to the PDTATAC through the appropriate Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or OSD member on the Civilian Advisory Panel. Justification for continuing a PDS designation as an isolated or remote location must reach the PDTATAC. B. Qualifications for Waiver.

Employment in another DoD Component without a Break in Service after Separation from the Losing Activity. When a civilian employee separates from a Service or Agency OCONUS and will be employed at a location other than the place where the Government would usually return the civilian employee, the transportation costs are split between the losing activity and the gaining activity. 1. The losing activity OCONUS pays a civilian employee\u2019s travel and transportation allowances to the authorized separation destination, limited to those payable to the actual residence, even if the civilian employee is employed, without a break in service, by a different DoD Component after arrival at the authorized separation destination. 2. If the new PDS is other than at the authorized separation destination, thereby requiring additional travel, the gaining DoD Component pays travel and transportation allowances if PCS allowances are authorized. Payments are limited to the constructed travel by a direct route from the old PDS OCONUS to the new PDS, less the cost of separation travel and transportation allowances paid by the losing activity OCONUS. If the gaining DoD Component authorizes PCS allowances and the civilian employee meets eligibility requirements, the gaining DoD Component is responsible for the mandatory and any discretionary allowances authorized.

The requirements in this paragraph are also used to determine the actual residence in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS. The location of the actual residence must be documented in the civilian employee\u2019s official personnel folder. The determination of the actual residence depends on the facts presented and is determined on a case-by-case basis. A. Appointees and Student Trainees. Authorized transportation to the first PDS must be from the appointee\u2019s actual residence at the time of selection or assignment. The actual residence is the location where the appointee lived before selection for the appointment or assignment. If the appointee claims another location as the actual residence at the time of selection, the appointee must prove that the residence where the appointee lived at the time of selection is temporary and the actual residence is elsewhere. B. Employment OCONUS. Actual residence must be determined when an individual initially is appointed or transferred to a PDS OCONUS. The Government\u2019s obligation for travel and transportation allowances is limited to movement to and from a civilian employee\u2019s actual residence at the time of assignment to duty OCONUS, when the travel is to a PDS OCONUS upon assignment, when it is round- trip travel under a renewal agreement, or when it is return travel for separation.

Ordinarily, the actual residence is a fixed residence. This can be the place from which transferred or appointed or where a dependent and HHG are at the time of an individual\u2019s appointment or transfer to a position OCONUS. The request of an appointee or civilian employee to specify a location that he or she cannot justify as the actual residence to establish residence at, or to visit, a certain location must not be a basis for designating that place as the actual residence. Consider carefully all facts concerning the civilian employee\u2019s residence before assignment to duty OCONUS, including all of the following: a. Home ownership. b. Previous residence. c. Temporary employment in the city where recruited. d. Employment requiring residence apart from the family. e. The civilian employee\u2019s voting residence. f.

A renewal agreement is negotiated with a civilian employee who has an initial agreement when the tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS is completed satisfactorily and who has an actual residence outside the geographical employment locality.

When a married couple are both civilian employees in the same locality OCONUS, a renewal agreement is negotiated either separately or with one as head of the household and the other treated as a spouse. Both spouses must sign a written statement agreeing to the decision. A copy is filed in each civilian employee\u2019s personnel folder. If negotiated separately, neither civilian employee may be treated as a spouse and a dependent may not benefit twice. A civilian employee who chooses travel and transportation allowances as a spouse does not forfeit authorized allowances for return travel accrued under an initial agreement. When spouses have independently earned travel and transportation allowances and chose for one to be treated as a dependent, and the employment of the head-of-household ceases in the Federal Government, the still-employed spouse may revert to the agreement in force before the decision. This allows the still-employed spouse to negotiate RAT, if eligible. In computing the time limits for required service, the time begins when the civilian employee returns to the location OCONUS from the last renewal-agreement trip, either under the civilian employee\u2019s or the spouse\u2019s agreement, whichever trip under the agreement ends later (54 Comp.

Before performing RAT, the civilian employee must sign a renewal agreement to serve a tour of duty applicable to the new PDS. I. Civilian Employee Not Needed for Full Tour of Duty. When it is known in advance that a civilian employee is not needed for the full tour of duty OCONUS, employment may be for a lesser period without affecting travel and transportation allowances to the PDS OCONUS and return for the purpose of separation (26 Comp. Gen. 488 (1947)). The service agreement must specify a 12-month tour of duty according to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a75722.

A civilian employee or appointee who violates a service agreement, other than for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the Service or Agency, must reimburse the Government all costs paid for relocation expenses paid based on that service agreement, including a withholding tax allowance and a RIT allowance. (FTR \u00a7302-2) A. Responsibilities. A civilian employee is responsible for reporting to the designated PDS. If the civilian employee does not arrive at the new PDS, resigns, or arrives at the new PDS and refuses to perform the mission, he or she is required to repay any PDT allowances that the Government has already reimbursed. The civilian employee also may be indebted to the Government for travel, transportation, and relocation expenses incurred on behalf of a civilian employee under other circumstances in this Chapter (CBCA 3804-RELO, June 24, 2014).

Another service agreement being signed incident to a subsequent transfer. 2. The service agreement\u2019s time limit is waived if the civilian employee fails to comply with the requirement for reasons beyond his or her control for reasons acceptable to the employing Department or Agency. In that case, the civilian employee has no liability. The time limit for each service agreement violated must be waived separately. D. Agreement Violations for a Civilian Employee OCONUS 1. Violation during the First Year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement. A civilian employee OCONUS who leaves Government service for reasons unacceptable to the last assigned Agency before completing 12 months of service under the initial service agreement is financially responsible to the Government for travel and transportation allowances and associated costs for the move to that PDS. These include the travel and transportation allowances for the civilian employee, eligible dependents, HHG (including SIT and NTS) a POV, and a mobile home. Return travel is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. A civilian employee who departs from a PDS OCONUS for authorized leave, with or without pay, before the end of the first year of an initial service agreement, and resigns while away for reasons unacceptable to the Agency, is allowed credit for the authorized leave time toward completion of the minimum service requirement (see B-184948, November 18, 1975). The provisions of this paragraph apply to each civilian employee OCONUS. Additional penalties may apply to a DODEA teacher. 2. Violation after 1 year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement.

When the civilian employee is separated from Government service, he or she may apply his or her unused allowances to return travel. If the amount of the unused allowances is less than the costs to return to the actual residence, the difference is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. Although the difference is the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation, but must collect the difference from the civilian employee. If the amount of the unused allowances is greater than or equal to the costs to return to the actual residence, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation in full. The civilian employee may choose to pay the total costs and submit a reimbursement claim for the applicable amount. Additional penalties for DODEA teachers may apply. c. If a civilian employee serves 1 or more years under a renewal agreement, but does not serve the entire period in the renewal agreement, the separation has the following effects on a civilian employee\u2019s travel and transportation allowances.

Use the common user tariff rate to compute the AMC transportation cost. If these rates are not available at the activity OCONUS, they may be obtained from the nearest Military Sealift Command or AMC traffic officer by submitting a request that contains the travel and transportation dates, terminal points, names of persons concerned, and baggage weight. B. Commercial Airplane, Train, Bus, or Ship Transportation Costs. Computation of commercial airplane, train, bus, or ship transportation cost within the CONUS must be based on the Government cost, without tax, for the accommodations in par. 020207. The civilian employee must be allowed appropriate credit for Government-procured transportation documents or any unused tickets that are returned. C. Travel Time Compensation. Travel time compensation is not a travel cost and is not considered in computing liability. D. Per Diem. Per diem for travel performed must be considered in computing liability. 03/01/2025 5G-16 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B E.

Travel and transportation allowances for subsequent reassignments within the command OCONUS, directed by the employing activity, are not the civilian employee\u2019s financial responsibility. F. Return Travel Costs 1. Government\u2019s Obligation. When sufficient travel and transportation allowances exist to cover travel costs for the full distance from the official PDS OCONUS to the actual residence, those allowances are authorized to return the civilian employee to the actual residence. At that point, the Government\u2019s obligation is fulfilled. 2. Civilian Employee\u2019s Obligation. When it is determined insufficient travel and transportation allowances exist to cover travel costs for the full distance from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the costs to the actual residence that are greater than the civilian employee\u2019s allowances. The civilian employee may provide the transportation and be reimbursed for whatever amount the Government would have paid upon submission of an appropriate voucher and receipts for claimed expenses. The civilian employee is authorized Government transportation, if available, from the area OCONUS to the port of debarkation, or beyond; however, collections for excess costs should be made before the travel begins, if required by finance regulations. The civilian employee may be authorized repatriation transportation if he or she has insufficient funds to pay for return HHG shipment expenses, including SIT at the origin, and he or she meets the requirements for repatriation travel.

All Areas OCONUS, Except Alaska and Hawaii. A civilian employee must meet the requirements in this paragraph to be eligible for RAT. Before departure from the PDS OCONUS, a civilian employee must have satisfactorily completed the tour of duty (see Tour Lengths) and have entered into a new written service agreement for another tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS. To be eligible for renewal agreement travel, a civilian employee must have a minimum period of at least 12 months of service remaining from the date of return to the same or different PDS OCONUS (FTR \u00a7302-2.14). The new service agreement covers costs for travel to the civilian employee\u2019s actual residence or alternate location according to this Part and return, and any additional cost paid by the Government due to the civilian employee\u2019s transfer to another PDS OCONUS for the tour immediately after the RAT. B. Civilian Employee Stationed in Alaska or Hawaii on September 8, 1982. A civilian employee serving in Alaska or Hawaii is eligible to receive RAT allowances if on September 8, 1982, any of the following requirements applied and he or she continued to serve consecutive tours of duty within Alaska or Hawaii, as appropriate, within the same state: 1. The civilian employee must have been serving a tour of duty in Alaska or Hawaii. 2. The civilian employee was en route to a PDS in Alaska or Hawaii under a written service agreement to serve a tour of duty. 3.

Civilian Employee Assigned, Appointed, or Transferred to a Post of duty in Alaska or Hawaii after September 8, 1982 1. The travel and transportation allowances for RAT may not be authorized for a civilian employee assigned, appointed, or transferred to a PDS in Alaska or Hawaii after September 8, 1982, unless the DoD Component determines that payment of these expenses is necessary for recruiting or retaining a civilian employee for that tour of duty and the following apply: 03/01/2025 5H-1 Intro Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Appendix A Appendix B a. RAT is required to fulfill DoD Component staffing needs for mission accomplishment. This is intended to ensure the availability of a well-qualified civilian employee or a civilian employee with special skills and knowledge who is not otherwise available in the local area and to fill remote area positions. b. RAT is necessary as a recruiting or retention incentive to fill a particular position in Alaska or Hawaii. The DoD Component must specify in writing the criteria and guidelines to determine the need for RAT, and must review and re-confirm in writing at least every 5 years the requirement to offer RAT. 2.

A civilian employee is authorized per diem during the en route RAT between the PDSs OCONUS and the authorized RAT destination. No per diem is authorized for the civilian employee\u2019s dependent for RAT when the civilian employee returns to the same PDS OCONUS for duty. However, when the civilian employee reports to a different PDS OCONUS for duty after RAT, per diem is authorized for a dependent while en route, limited to the constructed time by the usual transportation mode and route directly between the old and new duty locations OCONUS.

Delay at Management\u2019s Request. Management may request a civilian employee to delay RAT by extending the initial tour, or tour then in effect, up to 90 days for good reasons, such as if the civilian employee is engaged on a project that is scheduled for completion within a reasonable time. Sufficient time must remain in the civilian employee\u2019s renewal-agreement tour following RAT for him or her to serve at least 12 months upon return to the PDS OCONUS. This is after shortening the length of the renewal-agreement tour by the number of days that the initial tour was extended. C. Delay at the Civilian Employee\u2019s Request. A civilian employee may request an extension of the initial tour or the tour then in effect to permit scheduling leave to accommodate personal or job- related reasons acceptable to, and permitted by, the commander concerned OCONUS. After performing RAT and returning to the PDS OCONUS, the civilian employee\u2019s tour is either 12 months or the length of the renewal-agreement tour for the PDS concerned shortened by the number of days the initial tour was extended, whichever is greater. D. Limits on Assignments OCONUS. A delay in performing RAT should not be authorized if the resulting extension to the new tour, or the requirement to serve 12 months following the return to the PDS OCONUS, requires the civilian employee to remain at the PDS OCONUS beyond any 5-year limit, or other limit, on assignments OCONUS contained in personnel guidance. A delay in RAT may be authorized if the civilian employee is not affected by, or has been released from, the 5-year limit, or other limit, on assignments OCONUS. \u2026continued"}
