Expense Limitation: Miscellaneous rental car expenses may not exceed $100 per day or a total of $500 within the travel period (see Chapter 2). Example: A Service member uses a rental car to complete their official orders, but the cost of using the car is more than the allowed $100 per day. The expenses incurred during the travel with the rental car are not considered miscellaneous reiimbursable expenses. 2. Renting a Car for Personal Use.

If a Service member travels between official locations using an AOC (Air Operations Center) or RTCC (Real Time Communication Center), and also takes leave while on the AOC/RTCC, then the authorized travel time for MALT Plus is 8 x 30 = 240 days. So total days paid in connection with official PCS orders are 75 days. But if a Service member takes leave when using an AOC or RTCC and then returns to service before leaving again, then the authorized travel time for MALT Plus is reduced by 1 day. So total days paid in connection with official PCS orders are 64 days. If a Service member travels from one official location to another with leave days left to be used while traveling, then the authorized travel time for MALT Plus is reduced by 2 days.
